\section{Profile}
I am currently an undergraduate at the University of York where I am in my final
year of studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I already have a year of
professional experience in an IT role and am now looking for a graduate role in
a similar area. Available from July 2017 full-time.

\section{Experience}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{@{}L R@{}}

  Industrial placement year, where time was split between largely Linux based
  technical support and software development. Phone \& email support with
  customers. Gave significant experience with domains, networking and
  webservers. Also did out-of-hours support one week per month and occasionally
  did physical work in the data centre itself building servers and running
  cables. Development work was split between maintaining a Ruby-on-Rails program
  responsible for mapping IP address space and working on a compatibility layer
  for this and another system, with Python and Go.
